INTRODUCTION
------------

A simple way to create and maintain how elements fade in, triggered when they enter the viewport. An open-source experiment from @JulianLloyd.

You may have seen this technique in the "single page" websites that are often step based marketing pages for an event, company services or a new product.

TESTED
-----

@todo
This module has been manually tested successfully creating several working JQuery scroll items in Backdrop.

KNOWN ISSUES
---------------------
@todo
This module works as is by just installing it.

This module bundles a third-party Javascript scrollReveal.js from <https://github.com/julianlloyd/scrollReveal.js>

Big thanks to Julian Lloyd for this functionality.

Probably the preferred way to do this module is to use the Libraries module to bundle instead like this documentation:
<https://www.drupal.org/project/scrollreveal>

If it bothers you that we don't use the Libraries module, file an issue and we can try to change it.

When official information on using third-party JQuery plugins becomes known, this will follow it.
